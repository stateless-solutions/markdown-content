**Alpha Access Disclaimer:** Thank you for showing interest in becoming a data
service provider on Stateless. At present, we're not accepting new providers
during our alpha phase. However, if you wish to be considered for future
integration or have any queries, please reach out to us at
support@stateless.solutions.

# Provider Onboarding

External data service providers play a crucial role in the Stateless network.
This guide ensures a smooth integration into our infrastructure, allowing you
to offer data services seamlessly.

## Account and API Key Creation

Every provider requires a dedicated account on Stateless for integration and to
manage their cryptographic API keys, which are crucial for request-response
signatures.

**Account Setup**

1. Navigate to [app.stateless.solutions](https://app.stateless.solutions).
2. Choose "Sign Up" and authenticate using GitHub SSO.
3. Post-authorization, you'll gain access to your Stateless dashboard.

**API Key Pair Creation**

On your dashboard, head over to the 'API Keys' section.

1. Click 'Create API Key'
2. Label your key for easy identification
3. Save the generated key in a secure location

Please note that Stateless will not display your API keys after their initial
generation, and once they are revoked, they cannot be reused.
