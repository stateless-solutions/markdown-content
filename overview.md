# Overview

## Introduction to Stateless

Stateless develops trustless standards designed to secure and enhance decentralized data operations. Our mission is to provide developers with the tools they need to build secure, decentralized applications through client-side verification, risk management protocols, and standardized compute interfaces. Stateless encompasses three key components:

<br>

1. **Stateless API Service**: Our current product offering, verifiable APIs, allows developers to securely access and interact with blockchain data through public and private endpoints.
2. **Stateless Verification Standard**: Robust frameworks that ensure data interactions are deterministic, auditable, and verifiable across decentralized networks.
3. **Stateless Risk Management Protocol**: An innovative protocol designed to manage risk through permissionless dispute resolution and data integrity verification, protecting users and providing real yield through collateralized risk pools.

For a more detailed overview of our approach and vision, please refer to our [**litepaper**](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6422566ec8dc0e166c11c5bd/t/65b36b76c468313aacce529b/1706257270111/litepaper+%2810%29.pdf).

## Current Product and Service

**Verifiable RPC APIs**
<br>
Our current offering includes verifiable RPC APIs that provide a frictionless experience for application developers to secure their existing applications. These APIs support both historic and real-time verification, ensuring that invalid responses can be audited, stopped, or self-corrected as needed. 

<br>

Developers can select as many providers as they wish to source data from and set the number of attestations required to accept that data, similar to setting up a multisig Safe wallet. We provide both public and private endpoints alongside customized SDKs that are backward compatible with existing workflows.

<br>

**Consumable Light Clients**
<br>
We offer a consumer light client framework to enable trustless interactions with EVM networks. Developers can consume the `eth_getProof` method across Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum from our custom Ethers library.

## Upcoming Services

**AI Clients**
<br>
In addition to our blockchain-focused solutions, Stateless is developing an AI client to increase confidence in decentralized inference and automation. Extending our verification to AI execution, our clients will provide developers access to deterministic models that can be consumed and deployed across decentralized applications. Open-source models will be optimized across a variety of GPUs and weights to support a broad range of demands.

## Future Protocol Developments

**Distributing Stateless Verification Standards**
<br>
Our standards enable anyone to make decentralized data trustless and verifiable. Soon, these standards will be open-sourced and distributed through existing protocols, infrastructures, and tooling, significantly enhancing security across various decentralized applications.

<br>

Stateless standards are designed for seamless integration, capable of working with or replacing protocol execution layers to enable verifiable data interactions without altering core infrastructure. They are also compatible with existing infrastructure tools and services, ensuring easy adoption and minimal disruption to current workflows.

<br>

Much like SSL acts as a critical security tool for web security, Stateless serves as an essential security layer for users in decentralized environments. By distributing our verification standards through existing protocols and platforms, we effectively reach and protect end users, ensuring their interactions within decentralized applications are secure and trustworthy.

**Stateless Risk Management Protocol**
<br>
Our upcoming risk management protocol will enable anyone to leverage real-time verification and permissionless dispute resolution across any provider servicing protocols with the Stateless standard. This first-of-its-kind protocol will protect and compensate users with real yield through collateralized risk pools. Using an optimistic design, the protocol acts as a permissionless and non-taxing arbitrator that ensures that data discrepancies are remediated.

## Conclusion

By leveraging Stateless, developers can enjoy the benefits of decentralized technology while protecting their resources and users from the risks associated with data inconsistencies and trust compromises. Stay tuned for more developments as we continue to distribute and develop the Stateless protocol.
