# Overview

## Introduction to Stateless

Stateless is a verifiability protocol for securing and enhancing decentralized data operations. With easily consumable standardized compute interfaces, Stateless APIs enable
developers to build web3 applications and access numerous services with confidence, knowing
that they are operating within a secure, decentralized environment. For a more
detailed overview of our approach and vision, please refer to our
[**litepaper**](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6422566ec8dc0e166c11c5bd/t/65b36b76c468313aacce529b/1706257270111/litepaper+%2810%29.pdf).

Stateless, as a protocol, does not rely on a native blockchain. Instead, it uses a system of exchange based on compute credits and
stablecoins to ensure availability on provider servers. By using Stateless,
developers can enjoy the benefits of decentralized technology while mitigating the
risks associated with data inconsistencies and trust compromises.
