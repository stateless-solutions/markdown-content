# Overview

## Introduction to Stateless

Stateless is an API middleware that ensures data integrity and financial
security for blockchain Remote Procedure Call (RPC) responses. Stateless allows
developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) with confidence, knowing
that they are operating within a secure, decentralized environment. For a more
detailed overview of our approach and vision, please refer to our
[**litepaper**](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6422566ec8dc0e166c11c5bd/t/6595d246145dea1ad173ef0f/1704317511084/litepaper+%286%29.pdf).

Stateless, as a protocol, does not rely on a native blockchain or
token. Instead, it uses a system of exchange based on compute credits and
stablecoins to ensure availability on provider servers. By using Stateless,
developers can enjoy the benefits of blockchain technology while mitigating the
risks associated with data inconsistency and security.
