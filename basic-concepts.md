# Basic Concepts

## Secure API Services

API services in Stateless are specifically built to provide a safe and reliable data source for dApps. These services operate on a decentralized node network, adhering to our custom RPC modifications and offering signed attestations for every request they service.

Applications on Stateless build their custom buckets of providers to service their needs. This approach differs from conventional networks, where you have little to no control over what nodes are servicing your requests. By receiving data from multiple providers, applications on Stateless have a reliable source of truth that they control and can configure to their own tolerance thresholds.

## Compute Credits

Instead of relying on a proprietary blockchain or a native token, Stateless introduces compute credits. Compute credits are a novel way to guarantee availability on provider servers by allowing applications to exchange stablecoins (specifically, $USDC) for these credits.

These compute credits are non-transferable ERC-20 tokens. They cannot be exchanged or traded but can only be refunded by the applications or consumed by the network for service. It's important to note that these credits are purely utility tokens, not financial instruments, designed solely to facilitate your interaction with the Stateless platform.

By leveraging compute credits, Stateless ensures that applications can access the computational resources they need without needing a native blockchain or token system. This innovative approach enables users to focus on building and deploying high-quality decentralized applications while Stateless takes care of the resource allocation in a transparent and predictable way.
