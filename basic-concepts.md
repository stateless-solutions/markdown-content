# Basic Concepts

## Verifiable APIs

Stateless's APIs are built to provide safe and reliable
decentralized data sources for developers. Operating across a
distributed node network, the Stateless protocol enables efficient client-side verification, whether historically or in real-time.
<br/><br/>

## Data Provider Buckets

A provider bucket refers to a personalized
selection of data providers chosen by developers to service their requests.
Unlike conventional networks where nodes are assigned randomly, provider
buckets empower developers to customize their service network. Each bucket can
contain multiple providers, selected based on factors like supported
blockchains, regions, and latency performance.
<br/><br/>

When developers send requests, Stateless employs a routing system that
directs the request to the nearest provider within the chosen bucket. By creating custom service networks, developers can receive data from 1-many providers for reliable sources of truth that can be configured to their own requirements.
