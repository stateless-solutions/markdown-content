# Service Expectations and Responsibilities

Data Service Providers on the Stateless network are required to abide by the
Service Level Agreement (SLA) and follow the Standard Operating Procedure
(SOP). The main responsibilities, as outlined in the SLA, include:&nbsp;  

- **Onboarding:** Adhering to the onboarding process as described in the SOP.
- **Maintenance:** Routine updates, modifications, and enhancements to meet the
  evolving network demand, encompassing the specified maintenance requirements
  in the SOP.
- **SLA and SOP Compliance:** Upholding the promised level of service and
  ensuring adherence to both the SLA and SOP.
- **Monitoring and Self-Correction:** Persistent monitoring of node performance
  and enacting requisite adjustments to remain compliant.
- **Handling Penalizations:** Responding to and addressing any penalizations
  resultant from non-compliance with the standards outlined.

## Performance Expectations
&nbsp;  
To ensure optimal service delivery, the following performance expectations have
been established:
&nbsp;  
- Restrict the rate of request retries to no more than 5 retries within a
  30-second window.
- Ensure that 99.9% of responses from their nodes align with the anticipated
  outcome over a continuous 1-week span.
- Promptly address any technical difficulties within a 24-48 hour timeframe.
  Failure to address these issues might lead to the suspension of their
  service, contingent upon Stateless's sole discretion.

## Monitoring and Penalties
&nbsp;  
A comprehensive system for alerting and monitoring node performance is in
place. This system diligently tracks each provider's uptime, the accuracy of
responses, and any anomalies or deviations from non-malicious patterns.
Anomalies detected are automatically logged for future analysis. This ongoing
analysis process allows for continuous refinement and enhancement of the
monitoring system, ensuring optimal service performance and compliance with
data provider service expectations.&nbsp;  

Activities that jeopardize the service's availability and reliability, such as
prolonged downtime or inaccurate responses, are subject to penalties. The exact
repercussions of non-compliance can vary, spanning from withheld earnings to
temporary suspensions and even potential removal from the network. The
intensity of the penalty mirrors the magnitude and frequency of service
disruptions.&nbsp;  

Stateless retains the authority to determine non-compliance individually and
enforce penalties or service termination as deemed necessary to uphold the
network's quality standards.
